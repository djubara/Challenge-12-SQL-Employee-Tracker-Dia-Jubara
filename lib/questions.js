// Description: This file contains the questions for the user input.
// The questions are exported and used to generate a table in CLI.

// This block of code builds the Content Management System (CMS) and it
// is a good example of how to use the Inquirer package to create a CLI application.
// The code is well-organized and easy to read. The questions are defined as an array of objects,
// each representing a different question. The questions are then passed to the Inquirer.prompt()
// function to display them in the CLI and collect user input.

// Text input block
